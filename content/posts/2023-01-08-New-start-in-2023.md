# New Start in 2023

Happy new year! I am back after over 4 years and 3 months from my last post. A lot happened in the past 4 years. Personal wise, I moved to a new city, got engaged, got a dog, reached 30 year old. Career wise, I joined and left two companies, took some part time gigs in the meantime. However, I feel like I was stagnant in personal growth especially in the past 2 years. My time was occupied by my full time job, I did not get the chance to learn and read and made little progress on my longer term life goals.
