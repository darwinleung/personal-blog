# New Start in 2023

Happy new year! I am back after over 4 years and 3 months from my last post. A lot happened in the past 4 years. Personal wise, I moved to a new city, got engaged, got a dog, reached 30 year old. Career wise, I joined and left two companies, took some part time gigs in the meantime. However, I feel like I was stagnant in personal growth especially in the past 2 years. My time was occupied by my full time job, I did not get the chance to learn and read and made little progress on my longer term life goals.

# What am I doing lately?

TL;DR I got laid off by Meta and I am unemployed at the moment. A bit of context: I joined Meta as a data scientist from Uber in 2021 May during COVID, have been working in Toronto remotely for about a year, then moved to the bay area in July 2022 as they enforce return to office policy. I spent a couple month there myself living right by the Menlo Park office. In Nov 2022, they announced their first ever layoff of the company, I was one of them. I moved back to Toronto to spend time with my fiance and my dog. I took a short break during the holiday season. And now I am back! 

I will share more about the work at Meta and what is my plan in Canada.
