We finished a indie game called "[Limbo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/)" over the weekend. Personally I like it very much, It is a short, simple, monochrome, 2D puzzle solving game. Although there is no exciting story or flashy graphic, the music and animation is outstanding, puzzles are well designed, it kept us engaged for hours. 

I bought this game long time ago, never get time to try it until this Saturday I was downloading another large game, I decided to give it a try while we wait.

Then we totally forgot about the other game. The control is very simple and the puzzles are fun to solve. In the beginning and they were fairly simple then it got more and more challenging. At about 2/3 of the game, we got stuck and had to look it up. We realized that this game is not only problem solving but also execution. We have to keep trying to get the exact timing for some puzzles. Near the end, we spent significantly more time on each puzzle and to be honest it was a bit frustrated, but once we solved it, it was satisfying. 

I found it just like many other non-prioritized tasks at work/ self study, I know if we pause now then we will never have the motivation to get back to it. We just have to hang it there and give it another try. We managed to finish it before bed time. It felt accomplishing.

Spoiler: My favorite part of the game is the floating boxes one with the use of gravity, Rita's favorite part is cropping the spider legs.

TL;DR yes I would recommend to spend a weekend on it.
