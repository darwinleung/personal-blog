This is my first personal blog and this is my first blog post, building a blog is one of the goals I set at the beginning of 2018. 2018 would be my year of learning, I will spend my spare time on learning for both professionally and personally. I am lucky that there are many areas overlapping.

There are 3 main areas I want to learn: 

## Machine Learning

As an aspiring data scientist, I need to build a strong foundation on statistical and machine learning and gain exposure in deep learning. I will need to brush up my technical skills and pick up some new libraries and tools. I want to be able to come up with solutions for whatever data projects I am going to face and to have more tools under my belt to implement the solutions.

## Programming & Problem Solving

Data scientist often work with engineers and developers. It is going to be very helpful if I have knowledge of data engineering and their best practice. Skills like version control, web development, code deployment, DevOps etc. are all nice-to-have. I want to build a solid foundation in computer science like algorithm and data structure. This is going to be very helpful down the road, especially in a start-up environment like Shared. Also, personally, I enjoyed problem-solving in general, sometimes I just do it for fun, I want to get better at it.

## Investing

As a fresh graduate and young professional, it is the first time I can start working with my savings. Learning how to manage money is probably one of the most important skills as an adult. My goal is to reach a point that I don't have to trade my time for money (aka financial freedom). ​
